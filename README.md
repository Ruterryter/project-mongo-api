# Mongo API Project

This project was about how you model data in Mongoose and fetch items from a Mongo database using Mongoose and also seed the data. 


## The problem

I used data with 500 tophits from Spotify and made it a bit smaller using Mongoose model. I used a path listing all songs and that you could query songs by genre and find them by there id.
